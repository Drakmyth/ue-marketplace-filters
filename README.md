* Make sure you are using the latest Release version of the script. Old versions of the script are unsupported. Features and fixes will not be backported to old versions.
* Search to see if someone else has already reported the bug. Duplicate reports just slow down getting things fixed.

Keep it succinct and on-point, and only one feature per request, or it will be closed as "Invalid". Then we'll discuss your idea some and decide whether to implement it or not.
